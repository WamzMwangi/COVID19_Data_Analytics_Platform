### SQL: Data Ingestion and Visualization Project

This repository is part of a practical lesson where I guide my students through integrating data from CSV files into a relational database, applying basic database design and normalization principles, and then connecting the database to a visualization tool for interactive data analysis. The project uses a real-world COVID-19 dataset to demonstrate end-to-end basic data ingestion and normalization on MySQL.
