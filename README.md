### SQL: Data Ingestion and Visualization Project

This repository is part of a practical lesson where I guide my students through integrating data from CSV files into a relational database, applying basic database design and normalization principles, and then connecting the database to a visualization tool for interactive data analysis. The project uses a real-world COVID-19 dataset to demonstrate end-to-end basic data ingestion and normalization on MySQL.

#### ðŸ“– Learning Outcomes
By the end of this practical lesson, students should be able to confidently:
- Import csv/xlxs data into a MySQL database
- Design a normalized database scheme, based on the data in the import file (basic data modelling)
- Draw a complete Entity Relationship Diagram based on the designed schema
___
#### Step-by-by Guide
**1. Create a dedicated GitHub repo for your project**
As you write your queries (your sql code) on MySQL workbench, save those scripts such as in this case, _covid19_databse.sql_ in the project folder. Git add, commit and push any changes to GitHub as you would any other file. This is the simplest most straight forward way to do it, you can also explore ways to link your vscode to workbench to allow you to use the VS code UI to commit your changes.

**2. Identify your entities and their attributes**

**3. Perform database normalization**
**4. Create your ERD**
**5. Insert the relevant data into your tables**
